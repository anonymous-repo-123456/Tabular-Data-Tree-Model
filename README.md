# Tree Model for Classification

This repository provides an implementation of a classification method using a tree-based model. The code is intended for use with tabular data and aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
The code has been validated on the banknote dataset, and testing on other datasets requires only minor modifications.
